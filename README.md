## 2. Gameplay Features

### 2.1 Gesture-Based Spellcasting  
- Implements a custom spell recognition system using the **$P Point-Cloud Recognizer** (ported from C# to C++).  
- Players draw magical runes to cast spells directly on-screen.  
- Each spell represents emotional states—Light, Fire, Restoration, or Summoning—and evolves as players heal inner worlds.

### 2.2 Enemy AI and Combat  
- Designed with **Behavior Trees** and **EQS systems** for adaptive and reactive enemies.  
- Each enemy symbolizes psychological fears or myths from Slavic folklore.  
- AI dynamically reacts to player tactics, spell types, and proximity.

### 2.3 Narrative and Dialogue System  
- Built using **DataTables** and condition-based branching.  
- Each dialogue node contains: Speaker, Emotion, Line, Special Event, and Visual Cue.  
- Player choices influence story tone, NPC relationships, and memory restoration progress.

## 3. World Design

Players journey through six handcrafted dream biomes:

1. **The Playroom** – Childhood innocence fractured; unlocks the Light spell.  
2. **The Halls of Memories** – Shadows of grief; overcome the Moroi and unlock a cleansing spell.  
3. **The Mirror Room** – Confrontation with self-image; gain a reflection or deflection ability.  
4. **The Abandoned Nursery** – Puppet control and manipulation; earn the Puppeteer spell.  
5. **The Garden of Shadows** – Judgment and abandonment; environmental control and defense spells.  
6. **Domovoi’s Den** – The final realm of acceptance and closure; merge magic and memory to heal the mind.

Each biome reflects a stage of mental recovery and emotional growth.

## 5. Design Philosophy

> “We don’t just build worlds — we forge fables.”

Every mechanic in **Heart O’ Nightmare** reflects a psychological process:
- Combat mirrors the struggle to control inner fears.  
- Spells represent self-discovery and emotional resilience.  
- Death loops emphasize learning and personal growth through repetition.

The player’s progress is both mechanical and emotional—each encounter reshaping how they perceive themselves and the world.
